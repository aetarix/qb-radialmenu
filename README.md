# qb-radialmenu

Another small, simple release for the QBCore Community. We have dropped this small edit on the qbcore dependency 'qb-radialmenu' for the community.


# Changes Include:

Updated the regular QBCore red to align with our ProgresssBar update

Changed the functionality so its press to open instead of holding it.
